        A predator is an animal that hunts and kills other animals for food.
        They are an essential part of the food chain, playing a role in
        regulating prey populations. Predators typically have physical
        adaptations like sharp teeth, claws, or beaks that help them capture and
        consume their prey.

            <p>
              Deer are diverse, hoofed, ruminant mammals belonging to the family
              Cervidae, found across continents except Antarctica, known for
              their lean bodies, long slender legs, large ears, and the males of
              most species sporting antlers, which are shed and regrown
              annually. Their diet consists of vegetation like grass, twigs, and
              bark, and they are valued for their meat, hides, and antlers.

                  Diversity: The term "deer" encompasses over 40 species within

                  pudu to the large moose.

              Deer, (family Cervidae), any of 43 species of hoofed ruminants in
              the order Artiodactyla, notable for having two large and two small
              hooves on each foot and also for having antlers in the males of
              most species and in the females of one species. Deer are native to
              all continents except Australia and Antarctica, and many species
              have been widely introduced beyond their original habitats as game
              animals. One species, the reindeer , has been domesticated. Some
              swamp and island species are endangered, but most continental
              species are flourishing under protection and good management. .

            <p>
              Cows are large, domesticated, herbivorous mammals belonging to the
              genus Bos, distinguished by their four-chambered stomachs,
              two-toed (cloven) hooves, and their primary roles in providing
              milk and meat to humans. While the term "cow" specifically refers

              "cattle" encompasses bulls, cows, oxen, heifers, steers, bullocks,
